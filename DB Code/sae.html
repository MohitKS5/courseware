<h1> Difference between axle shaft and spindle</h1>
<pre>
        axle 					        shaft                                                       spindle
doesnt transmit power                     		does                                     the entire rotating assembly with shaft at its heart
may rotate or stand still                       attached to gears,pulley
derieved from axis:center of rotation           
</pre>

<h1>coupling</h1>
<h2>rigid coupling</h2>
for alighned shafts both laterally and angular
<h3>types</h3>
<h4>sleeve</h4> <ul>
					<li>as the name suggests a sleeve passes over both shafts and are angularly fixed by keys </li>
					<li>PRINCIPLE:groove locking</li>
				</ul>
<h4>clamp<</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>2 half cylindrical clamps clamped by through bolts like semicircle on center of a line </li>
					<li>PRINCIPLE:based on tight fit principal clearly</li>
				</ul>
<h4>flange</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>two disks with shaft passing from each(1 in each) and keyed. Now the two disks clamped by through bolts </li>

				</ul>


<H2>flexible coupling </H2>
for unalighned shafts 
<h3>types</h3>
<h4>bush pin</h4>
<ul>
	<li>bolts are fitted with flexible bushes </li>
	<li>for slight lateral misalignment </li>
	<li>range is less</li>
</ul>
<h4>Universal coupling </h4>
<ul>
	<li>for large angular misalignment basically ,may handle slight lateral also</li>
	<li>2 parts:cylinders fitted with tabs on diametrically  opposite directions </li>
	<li>2 parts are oriented in such a way the axis of tabs are perpendicular ,then a plus shaped assembly is inserted between fixed by collar pin fasteners .The shafts are fixed by keys .</li>
	 <li>it allows a misalignment of about 25 degrees</li>
	 <li>used in propeller shaft of automobiles as a CV joint</li>
</ul>
<h4>oldham coupling </h4>
<ul>
	<li>for lateral misalignments __</li>
	<li>3 part system - 2 metal and a plastic,2 disk shaped metal have a diametric groove. and a disk shaped plastic with external/extruded bits to fit into the grooves.</li>
	<li>the metals are misaligned and plastic is pressed in between , so it cant handle  axial outward forces as the plastic will slip off . </li>
	<li>well its made of plastic because it wears of due to shear and plastic can be replaced easily </li>	
</ul>
